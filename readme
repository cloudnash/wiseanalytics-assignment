📌 ##Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds, pushes, and deploys a containerized web application to a self-managed Kubernetes cluster using Jenkins.

Whenever code is pushed to the develop branch on GitHub, Jenkins:

Builds a Docker image

Pushes it to Docker Hub

Deploys the updated image to Kubernetes (staging environment)

Version Control: GitHub

CI/CD Tool: Jenkins

Containerization: Docker

Container Registry: Docker Hub

Orchestration: Kubernetes (Self-managed, not EKS)

Web Server: Nginx / Apache

OS: Linux (EC2)

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1️⃣ Code Push

Developer pushes code to develop branch

2️⃣ Jenkins Trigger

Jenkins pipeline starts automatically via GitHub webhook

3️⃣ Build Stage

Docker image is built using Dockerfile

4️⃣ Push Stage

Image is pushed to Docker Hub with versioned tags

5️⃣ Deploy Stage

Kubernetes deployment is updated using kubectl set image

Zero-downtime rollout handled by Kubernetes

🔐 Jenkins Credentials Used
Credential	Purpose
GitHub PAT	Repository access
Docker Hub creds	Push Docker images
kubeconfig	Access Kubernetes cluster


📜 Sample Jenkinsfile Stages

Checkout Code

Build Docker Image

Push Image to Docker Hub

Deploy to Kubernetes (staging)

🛠️ Kubernetes Deployment

Uses Deployment resource

Runs inside staging namespace

Image updates handled via rolling updates

Supports scaling and rollback

🧪 Verification Commands
kubectl get pods -n staging
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name> -n staging
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n staging

🎯 Key Learnings

Jenkins pipeline design using declarative syntax

Secure credential handling in CI/CD

Docker image versioning and registry integration

Kubernetes deployments using kubectl

End-to-end automation from GitHub to Kubernetes

🚧 Future Improvements

Add Helm for Kubernetes deployments

Introduce Blue/Green or Canary deployments

Add automated testing stage

Implement monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
